# AR Event Planner

AR Event Planner is a web-based application designed to help users visualize and plan events by overlaying AR objects (such as tables, chairs, and decorations) onto a real-world space. This project uses **WebXR**, **Three.js**, and modern web development tools like **Vite**, **React**, and **Tailwind CSS** to deliver an immersive and user-friendly experience.

---

## **Features**

- **Drag and Drop Functionality**: Easily drag objects from a side panel and place them onto the canvas view.
- **AR Object Visualization**: Overlay 3D objects onto the scene to see how they fit in your space.
- **Dynamic Scene Interaction**: Add, remove, and manipulate objects in a 3D environment.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes and devices.
- **Powered by WebXR**: Designed to integrate with augmented reality technologies in the browser.

## **Technologies Used**

### Frontend
- **React**: For building a modular and reusable UI.
- **Vite**: A fast and lightweight build tool.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and responsiveness.

### 3D Rendering
- **Three.js**: For creating and rendering the 3D environment.

### Drag-and-Drop
- **React DnD**: For intuitive drag-and-drop functionality.

### Augmented Reality
- **WebXR** (planned): For AR integration to overlay objects in real-world spaces.

## **Usage**

1. **Add Objects**: Drag objects (e.g., tables, chairs) from the side panel onto the canvas view.
2. **Customize Scene**: Interact with the objects in the canvas to arrange your event layout.
3. **Future AR Integration**: Once WebXR is fully integrated, use your device camera to overlay objects in the real world.

---

## **Planned Features**

- **AR Camera Mode**: Use WebXR to visualize objects in real-world spaces via a device camera.
- **Custom Object Upload**: Allow users to upload their own 3D models.
- **Object Customization**: Enable resizing, rotating, and changing object properties.
